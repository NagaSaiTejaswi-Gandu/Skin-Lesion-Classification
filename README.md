# "Skin Lesion Classification"
This project focuses on the classification of skin lesions using deep learning techniques, utilizing the HAM10000 dataset, which contains 10,015 dermatoscopic images from seven types of skin lesions, along with metadata such as patient demographics and diagnostic information. The objective is to develop and train a neural network model to classify these lesions accurately, aiding early detection and diagnosis.

The seven categories of skin lesions in the dataset are:
1. Melanocytic nevi
2. Melanoma
3. Benign keratosis-like lesions
4. Basal cell carcinoma
5. Actinic keratoses
6. Vascular lesions
7. Dermatofibroma

The project successfully trains a model for skin lesion classification, and with further enhancements in data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning, its performance can be improved. Grad-CAM visualizations also provide valuable insights into the model's decision-making process, making it a useful tool for medical diagnosis.
